This is the repository to share my code samples prior to the interview on 28-07-2017.

Please find code samples I've written here to answer 'General Awareness' and 'Technical Ability' questions.

How to build and run tests :

Technical Ability Question #1 :

1. Create a new java project
2. Add required Cucumber jars
3. Copy the 'SilverRail.feature' file into the 'src'folder
4. Create reqired 'Test Runner' java file
5. Create a 'Step Definitions' java file and implement all features in the 'SilverRail.feature' file
6. Run the feature file as a 'Cucumber Feature'

Technical Ability Question #2 :

1. Create a new java project
2. Import the respnse xml into the project folder
3. Copy the 'HelloXML.java' file into the project
4. Execute the 'HelloXML.java' file

Technical Ability Question #3:

Algorithm file : 'ShortestTrainPathAlgorithm.txt'
This is just a skeleton of the taks needs to be done
Detailed steps should be added but was unable due to time constraints
